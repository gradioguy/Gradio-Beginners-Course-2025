### **`gradio.JSON`**

#### **Description**
`gradio.JSON` is a component used to display arbitrary JSON data in a readable, prettified format. It is generally used to display output as JSON but rarely serves as an input component because it doesnâ€™t accept user input directly. It is ideal for situations where you need to show JSON data in a clean, organized way.

#### **Behavior**
- **As Input:**
  - When used as an input, the component passes the JSON data as either a dictionary or a list, depending on the value.
  - Your function should accept one of these types:
    ```python
    def predict(value: dict | list | None):
        ...
    ```

- **As Output:**
  - When used as an output, the component expects a valid JSON string or a dictionary/list that can be serialized into a JSON string. The dictionary or list can also contain `numpy` arrays.
  - Your function should return one of these types:
    ```python
    def predict(...) -> dict | list | str | None:
        ...
    return value
    ```

#### **Initialization Parameters**
- **value**: The initial JSON data (either a string, dictionary, list, callable, or `None`).
- **label**: Optionally provides a label for the component.
- **show_label**: Whether to display the label.
- **height**, **min_height**, **max_height**: Define the height of the JSON output display.
- **show_indices**: Whether to show the indices of list items in the JSON.
- **visible**: Control the visibility of the component.
- **open**: Whether the JSON output is initially expanded or collapsed.
- **inputs**: Define the inputs for the component.
- **scale**: Adjusts the size of the component.
- **elem_id**: Assigns a custom ID to the element.
- **elem_classes**: Allows for custom CSS classes.
- **container**: Whether the component should be placed inside a container.
- **render**: Whether to render the component immediately.

#### **Shortcuts**
- **gr.JSON**: `"json"` (Uses default values).

#### **Demos**

- **Zip to JSON Example:**
    ```python
    from zipfile import ZipFile
    import gradio as gr

    def zip_to_json(file_obj):
        files = []
        with ZipFile(file_obj.name) as zfile:
            for zinfo in zfile.infolist():
                files.append(
                    {
                        "name": zinfo.filename,
                        "file_size": zinfo.file_size,
                        "compressed_size": zinfo.compress_size,
                    }
                )
        return files

    demo = gr.Interface(zip_to_json, "file", "json")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        demo.launch()
    ```

In this example, a ZIP file is uploaded, and the details of the files within it are displayed in JSON format.

#### **Event Listeners**
Event listeners in Gradio allow you to respond to user actions within the app. The `gr.JSON` component supports the following event listener:

- **JSON.change(fn, ...)**: Triggered when the value of the JSON component changes, either from user input or a function update (e.g., updating the JSON data programmatically). This is similar to the `.input()` listener but can be triggered by changes made by functions as well.

---

#### **Event Parameters**
- **fn**: The function to handle the event.
- **inputs**: The components or blocks to be passed to the event.
- **outputs**: The components or blocks that will receive the output from the event handler.
- **api_name**: API name for the event (optional).
- **scroll_to_output**: Whether to scroll to the output after the event.
- **show_progress**: Defines the visibility of the progress (`'full'`, `'minimal'`, or `'hidden'`).
- **queue**: Whether to enable event queueing.
- **trigger_mode**: Defines the event trigger behavior (`'once'`, `'multiple'`, or `'always_last'`).
- **js**: JavaScript code to run for the event.
- **time_limit**: Limit the execution time for the event.
- **stream_every**: Interval for streaming data.

### **Summary**
`gradio.JSON` is a simple yet powerful component for displaying JSON data in a well-formatted way. It is primarily used to show structured data and is useful for scenarios where you need to present JSON output in a user-friendly manner. It supports event listeners that respond to changes in JSON values, enabling dynamic interactions within a Gradio app.
