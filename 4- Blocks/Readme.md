# Gradio Blocks  

## Overview

Gradio's `Blocks` class is a low-level API that gives you full control and flexibility over your web applications and demos, providing more customization options than the higher-level `Interface` class. It allows you to define components, layouts, and events in a more granular way. By using `Blocks`, you can create complex interactions and data flows, such as linking inputs to outputs, creating custom layouts, and defining more intricate behavior across components.

### Key Benefits:
1. **Custom Layouts**: You have full control over how components are arranged on the page.
2. **Complex Interactions**: You can create workflows where inputs trigger outputs, which can trigger further outputs, allowing for more sophisticated data flows.
3. **Grouping Demos**: Use `Blocks` to group related demos together, such as through tabs, offering a more cohesive user experience.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example: Dynamic Greeting Based on User Input

This example demonstrates a simple Gradio demo using `Blocks` where a user inputs their name, and the system returns a dynamic greeting.

```python
import gradio as gr

def update(name):
    return f"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!"

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("Start typing below and then click **Run** to see the output.")
    with gr.Row():
        inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
        out = gr.Textbox()
    btn = gr.Button("Run")
    btn.click(fn=update, inputs=inp, outputs=out)

demo.launch()
```

This example demonstrates the following:
- A `Textbox` for user input (name).
- A `Button` that, when clicked, triggers the `update` function, updating the output `Textbox` with a greeting.

### Basic Example: Text Change on User Input (Live)

In this version, the greeting will update as soon as the user types their name in the input box.

```python
import gradio as gr

def welcome(name):
    return f"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!"

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("""
    # Hello World!
    Start typing below to see the output.
    """)
    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
    out = gr.Textbox()
    inp.change(welcome, inp, out)

demo.launch()
```

This version uses the `.change()` method to trigger the `welcome` function automatically whenever the input value changes, eliminating the need for a button click.

## Methods

### `launch()`

**Description**: Launches the Gradio demo as a simple web server. You can also share the demo publicly by setting `share=True`.

#### Example Usage

```python
import gradio as gr

def reverse(text):
    return text[::-1]

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    button = gr.Button(value="Reverse")
    button.click(reverse, gr.Textbox(), gr.Textbox())

demo.launch(share=True, auth=("username", "password"))
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `share`: `bool | None` — Whether to share the demo publicly with a URL.
  - `auth`: `tuple[str, str] | list[tuple[str, str]]` — Authentication for private access.
  - Other parameters allow for server configuration, UI customization, and debugging.

### `queue()`

**Description**: By enabling the queue, you can control when users know their position in the queue and limit the number of events allowed.

#### Example Usage

```python
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    button = gr.Button(label="Generate Image")
    button.click(fn=image_generator, inputs=gr.Textbox(), outputs=gr.Image())

demo.queue(max_size=10)
demo.launch()
```

This enables queuing, which allows users to wait in line for the next available slot when the queue size exceeds the maximum allowed.

### `integrate()`

**Description**: This method integrates Gradio with external libraries like `comet_ml`, `wandb`, or `mlflow` after launching the demo.

#### Example Usage

```python
with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Textbox()
demo.launch()
demo.integrate(wandb=wandb)
```

You can use this to track experiments and log data during the demo.

### `load()`

**Description**: The `load()` listener is triggered when the Blocks interface initially loads in the browser. This is useful for performing setup tasks or initializing data.

#### Example Usage

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("# When the Blocks interface is loaded, this will print.")
    demo.load(lambda: print("Interface Loaded"))

demo.launch()
```

### `unload()`

**Description**: The `unload()` listener is triggered when the user closes or refreshes the tab. This can be used for cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources.

#### Example Usage

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("# When you close the tab, hello will be printed to the console")
    demo.unload(lambda: print("hello"))

demo.launch()
```

## Parameters for `Blocks`

- **theme**: `Theme | str | None` — Defines the overall theme (e.g., "light", "dark").
- **title**: `str` — The title displayed on the web page.
- **css**: `str | None` — Custom CSS to style the page.
- **js**: `str | None` — Custom JavaScript to add interactivity or modify behavior.
- **head**: `str | None` — Custom HTML content to include in the `<head>` tag of the page.
- **server_name**: `str | None` — Custom server name to host the app.

## Use Cases for `Blocks`

- **Complex User Flows**: `Blocks` allows you to manage complex input-output relationships, making it ideal for workflows that require step-by-step user interactions.
- **Custom Layouts**: You can design custom layouts using `Row`, `Column`, and other layout components.
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically update components based on user input or other triggers without requiring page reloads.

## Conclusion

Gradio `Blocks` is a powerful, flexible API that allows you to build sophisticated web applications entirely in Python. It provides complete control over the layout, event handling, and data flow, making it suitable for custom use cases and complex applications beyond what `Interface` offers. Whether you're building interactive demos, custom tools, or a multi-step application, `Blocks` provides the foundation to create seamless user experiences.
