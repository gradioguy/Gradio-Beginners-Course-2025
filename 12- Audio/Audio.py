The `gradio.Audio` component in Gradio allows users to upload, record, or play audio, functioning as both an input and output component. As input, it supports file paths or tuples containing sample rate and NumPy arrays of 16-bit audio data. As output, it can handle file paths, URLs, byte streams, or NumPy arrays (which are normalized to prevent clipping). It supports sources like uploads and microphones, offers configurable parameters like format (`wav`, `mp3`), autoplay, looping, and download buttons, and includes event listeners for actions like play, pause, record, and upload. This component is ideal for applications in speech recognition, music generation, and real-time audio processing. ðŸš€
